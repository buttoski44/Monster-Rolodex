2. it uses declerative way.all info is stored in object(state) and react takes desiscion based on the info in that objects(state)
3. component is JS functions/class that take attributes(props0) input and returns/render html(jsx)
4. state + component + JSX = virtual DOM
5. react act to change in state(object info)  
6 .onw way flow of data

1. in react we can return html/jsx using function as well as Classes
2. in order to return function through class we need to extend component class
